# stream_solutions
The goal of this repo is to present different streams solving problems for java 8 and above  for the following problems : 

We have a class Person (String name, int age, String nationality) 

- flatten a List<List<T>> to a List<String>
- groupByAttribute (nationalities)
- Return a comma-separated string of all these people's names
- Get the oldest person from the collection & Get max age inside collection
- Partition people into adults and kids, you'll need a special collector for this one
- Sum all elements of a collection, try to use the reduce operator with identity parameter instead of an IntStream
- Get the names of all kids under the age of 18

A test class is available under class folder
